# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Documentation**: root `BACKLOG.md` created. It carries open/pending items
  only — the build and analysis problems found by the Windows-lane audit
  (Windows 11, Dart SDK 3.13.1, HEAD `0b34b56`) and every divergence from the
  `staylorx/dart-flutter-bible` standard, the latter flagged for later review.

### Notes

- Decisions recorded by this pass:
  - `BACKLOG.md` holds open/pending items only; anything decided and done is
    recorded here instead.
  - Every divergence from `staylorx/dart-flutter-bible` is recorded in
    `BACKLOG.md` verbatim in the required
    `Deviation: <path> - <what diverges and why>` form and left unfixed — the
    bible itself may be the side that is wrong on several of them.
  - No source file was changed by this pass. Generated blobs (`doc/api/**`,
    `pubspec.lock`) were read only, never hand-edited.
- Audit record for the working version `0.9.18-dev` (not a cut release), HEAD
  `0b34b56`, Windows lane: `dart pub get` exit 0; `dart analyze` exit 0, "No
  issues found!"; `dart test` exit 0, 725/725 passing with 0 skips;
  `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` exit 1 (two unformatted
  files — BACKLOG.md B1); `dart pub publish --dry-run` exit 65 on a valid 743 KB
  archive (1 warning + 1 hint — BACKLOG.md B2/B3). No build error and no broken
  dependency was found.

  - Example: `IriTerm('http://example.org/subject')` → `const IriTerm('http://example.org/subject')`
  - Improves compile-time optimization and developer experience with better const usage patterns
- Introduced `IriTerm.validated()` non-const constructor to replace the old `IriTerm()` for cases where the input needs to be validated
